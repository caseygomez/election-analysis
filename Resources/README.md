This data is also useful for candidates when considering their run for election. They will be able to look at voter turnout trends and put resources towards areas with high voter turnout. This would also be helpful for community organizations interested in increasing participation and engagement in local elections by highlighting low voter turnout areas so that they can use their resources to get the message out.
